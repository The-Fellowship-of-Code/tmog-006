# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #006 - Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

***Constraints***

> - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104]. 
> - -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Examples

![binary tree sample](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

*Example 1*
> **Input**: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
> </br>**Output**: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

*Example 2*
> **Input**: root = []
> </br>**Output**: []

## Extra

Run, you fools! No extra spicy stuff this time.
